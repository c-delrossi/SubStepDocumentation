\chapter{Scope}

This chapter contains information about the scope of this thesis
and details which parts of the source code were created during this thesis and which parts were pre-existing.


\ \\
Originally, the focus of this thesis was completely on improving the usability of the Substitution Stepper.
However, during the duration of the project, some issues came up,
which showed that a reimplementation of the stepping mechanism might be beneficial.

Thus, the scope of the thesis grew and included the reimplementation of the stepping mechanism.
Features like sharing were dropped in favor of simplicity.

\ \\
Almost the whole source code was written as part of the thesis,
only excluding the code that is contained within the CoreStepper folder.
