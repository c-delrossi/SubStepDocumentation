\subsection{Automated Documentation Building}

A GitHub Action that automatically builds a PDF from the \LaTeX-files has been created.
This ensures that the documentation can be easily accessed and viewed without requiring a \LaTeX-environment.
The first step (starting on line 11) compiles the document and creates a PDF.
The second step (starting on line 16) uploads the PDF so that it can be downloaded from the GitHub repository.
